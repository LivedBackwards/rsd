Link to original RFC: [Really Simple Discovery 1.0.0](http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd)

> Really Simple Discovery is a way to help client software find the services needed to read, edit, or "work with" weblogging software. 
> Although I talk about weblogging software, there's no reason this format can't apply to other forms of web client/system software that I wasn't considering, or may not even exist as of this writing. 
> This format is simple but flexible. One of the deisgn goals was to ensure that it would be human writeable. 
> This was my "test" for ensuring that the format was easy for everyone to implement.

**The goal is simple. To reduce the information required to UserName, Password, and homepage URL.**
